 characteristics of Big data are:-
 a).volume-Volume Refers to the vast amounts of data generated every second
 b).Velocity-Velocity Refers to the speed at which new data is generated and the speed at which data moves around. 
 c).variety-Variety Refers to the different types of data we can now use. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The possible solutions to handle Big data are:-
  a) Scale up-• Increase the configuration of a single system, like disk capacity, RAM, data transferspeed, etc.• 
  Complex, costly, and a time consuming process
  b).scale out-• Use multiple commodity (economical) machines and distribute the load ofstorage/processing among them
  • Economical and quick to implement as it focuses on distribution of load
  • Instead of having a single system with 10 TB of storage and 80 GB of RAM, use 40machines with 256 GB of storage and 2 GB of RAM
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  the differences between scaling up and scaling out.
 a) Scale up-• Increase the configuration of a single system, like disk capacity, RAM, data transfer
speed, etc.
• Complex, costly, and a time consuming process
b).scale out-• Use multiple commodity (economical) machines and distribute the load of
storage/processing among them
• Economical and quick to implement as it focuses on distribution of load
• Instead of having a single system with 10 TB of storage and 80 GB of RAM, use 40
machines with 256 GB of storage and 2 GB of RAM
